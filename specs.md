# Products and Specificatons

Here's the building blocks for this project. The system as a whole
tries to optmize for the following:

* 12V power sources/consumption.
* Lower Power usage.
* Portability/Flexibility (easy setup/teardown)


## Base: RAM Promaster 1500 Hi-Top (2018)

### Power

* 2x200w Solar Panels
* 200Ah (~2400Wh) 12v LiPo Battery

### Decor


## Audio/Video

### Portable Power

* Rockpals 520Wh Bank
  * 4x 12V/10A outputs
  * Can charge/passthru when using DC only

### Projection System

* [MosicGO EliteProjector Ultra Short Throw](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SZ4WNJ5)
  * [Specification](https://www.eliteprojector.com/spec.html)
  * Draws about 70w or so, depending on brightness.
  * Does 9ft width at 32" from front, 40" from back.  (With some distortion)
* [Vivo Universal Ceiling Mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01014CD0O)
* [DC Converter 12V to 19V](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083TQS978)
* Crossbar
* Clamps

Sadly the MosicGO runs off 19v, so we have to add a transformer into
the mix.  You can get a version with a built-in 372,000mAh battery.  But
the upcharge and availability were not as easy.  For the same price
you can get an external battery that is usable for more things.

### Lighting

The LED system is currently just something really simple with a
bluetooth phone control over the visualizations.  Most of the time it
will just be in music visualizaton mode.

Future plans could involve adding some bluetooth triggering or adding
full DMX control.
